Notebooks that justify the assumptions in dfcbenchmarker simulations

dfcbenchmarker (https://github.com/wiheto/dfcbenchmarker) is a set of simulations which tests different methods ability to track a fluctuating covariance. The simulations aim to to evaluate different methods proposed within fMRI. A key component of these simulations is how well the simulated data corresponds to fMRI-like properties. This repo contains notebooks that justify some of the parameters. The version of dfcbenchmarker is the directory (e.g. 1.0) with the notebook inside.
