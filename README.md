# tvc_benchmarker_assumptions

Notebooks that justify the assumptions in tvc_benchmarker simulations. This repo accompanies the supplementary materials of [this article](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/01/212241)

tvc_benchmarker (https://github.com/wiheto/tvc_benchmarker) is a set of simulations which tests different methods ability to track a fluctuating covariance. The simulations aim to to evaluate different methods proposed within fMRI. A key component of these simulations is how well the simulated data corresponds to fMRI-like properties. This repo contains notebooks that justify some of the parameters. The version of tvc_benchmarker is the directory (e.g. 1.0) with the notebook inside.
